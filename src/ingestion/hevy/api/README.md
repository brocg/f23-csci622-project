# Hevy API Tips & Pointers
Consider this a "backdoor" API. All calls are subject to change. Nothing official here, but did confirm with Hevy this is allowed (as long as not abusing the free service).

## Routines
The core concepts of how data is structed in hevy revolves around routine. Think of a "workout routine" containing all the exercises you'll do for that training session. As a paid user, you can have unlimited routines. As a free user, you're capped at 3 routines.

## Exercises
Hevy provides a good general library of common exercises. If you need your own, you can create a "custom exercise" and once added, will show up in your workout library aside all the others.

You can make an API call specifically to see your list of custom exercises created.
